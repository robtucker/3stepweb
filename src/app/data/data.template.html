        <p>When it comes to data products, it's easy to get drowned in figures and lose sight of the bigger picture.
            We bring the same agile and action-oriented approach to data as we do to everything else.</p>

        <h2>Modern database systems</h2>
        <p>We've worked with all kinds of database layers, from traditional eneterprise systems such as Oracle, 
            to modern document stores and caching layers such as mongo or redis.</p>
        <p>We love server automation, and have a strong affinity for Ansible and Docker.</p>

        <h2>Opening up Machine Learning</h2>
        <p>In the past, big data was only for big companies. Now anyone can leverage the power of data analysis, 
            even on smaller projects.</p>
        <p>Tools like Elasticsearch enable you to implement advanced search algorithms 
            quickly and cheaply. Graph databases such as Neo4J are bringing a more sophisticated 
            level of data analysis to the open source world</p>
        <p>There are even out-of-the-box tools for advanced machine learning techniques, 
            such as neural networks. Talk to us to find out more.</p>

        <h2>Crawling the web</h2>
        <p>So much data is in the public domain now that using web crawlers is increasingly becoming a standard practice.</p>
        <p>We've done various forms of web automation for a number of different projects and we believe there 
            is often a strong business case for gathering intelligence online.</p>
