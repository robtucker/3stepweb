            at the bar or to buy their friends a drink from anywhere in the world.`,
        problem: `The DrinkZ team had app developers on board for the project but they needed a 
            backend infrastructure team to help develop the data API, permissions system, caching and to 
            provision & deployment web-servers.`,
        solution: `We started with with the application wireframes and designed the database ERD 
            and API entity model. We created a multi role permission system to accommodate the apps views 
            and use cases. We then built a lightweight and flexible REST Api using Laravel Lumen & Mysql 
            so that data could be stored and retrieved by the app. We optimized performance using Redis 
            object caching and developed a system for grouping api requests to minimize the number of 
            calls required`,

        solution: `We worked closely with the project management team to develop an agile workflow, 
            build a development team and design the apiâ€™s and frontend application. We built an api wrapper 
            to act as a pass through to their proprietary blackbox backend and we developed business logic 
            and data storage to meet the project spec. We then built the frontend application interface.`,
